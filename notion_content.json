Before you set off building and sharing, there are some important considerations for creating a template: Good templates are useful.Templates are tools; tools solve a clear problem or need for someone.

Differentiated templates combine one or more of Notion\u2019s core product types (docs, projects, and wikis), or are very clearly visually different than a basic word document. Good templates are scalable.If your template is intended for team use, it should be able to work with more than just one person. There are a few key points to check to ensure scalability: If it\u2019s intended for collaboration, what might this look like if you added 10 people? 50? 100?If you added content from the last two months, what would it look like?If you already have lots of stuff in your Notion, does it easily fit in?",

        "Answers to important questions live inside these pages, but team members often spend longer than they should hunting for vital information. Q&A surfaces answers immediately, so you can leverage all the information in your Notion workspace. For employees at Remote (a global HR platform of over 1,000+ distributed teammates), it used to take 5-10 minutes to find an answer to every question, multiple times a day. They\u2019re now using Q&A across their entire workspace to get answers in seconds. Instead of digging for information and context-switching throughout the day, you can stay focused. In this guide, we\u2019ll show how Q&A helps everyone work faster and move forward with work independently.",
        "Click the sparkle in the bottom right to open Q&A. Alternatively, find Q&A in the search menu. Q&A gives you the answers you need in seconds Regardless of your role, function, or company size, you probably spend a fair amount of time searching for the information you need to do your work. Even with a comprehensive knowledge base in Notion, team members don\u2019t always know how or where to find what they need. Often, information lives in a separate place from where they\u2019re working, or doesn\u2019t exist in a form they can make sense of. So they ping a DM or email to a colleague and have to wait for an answer.",
        "As a result, progress stalls and focus is broken. Team members are blocked until they get their answers, and the knowledge-keepers of your company are bombarded with routine questions that pull them away from more impactful work. But Q&A acts as a personal assistant to each team member so you can spend less time searching for vital information. Thanks to its extraordinary ability to search thousands of docs in seconds, Q&A gives team members what they need, in a fraction of the time it takes to DM your colleague and get a response. Ask Q&A for help with any work-related problem. Ask your Q&A assistant anything Whenever a question about work arises, you can consult Q&A first to find out if the answer is already documented in Notion.",
        "To open Q&A, click on the sparkle in the bottom right of your Notion window and start typing your request into the text box as a naturally-worded question.

        "Unblock yourself faster with Q&A Q&A makes AI a useful tool for everyone and can have a tangible impact on day-to-day work. You can use Q&A no matter what team you\u2019re on. Let's look at examples. Engineers get assistance with technical queries As an engineer, the last thing you want is to break your flow when you\u2019re in the middle of fixing a complex bug. If you need to check how something should be done, instead of contacting your manager or reading through all your lengthy process docs, you can open up Q&A and get an instant answer to your question. When your engineering wiki lives in Notion, you can use Q&A to unblock yourself and get on with work faster.",
        "Andrew Pett, Staff Backend Engineer from Remote, explained how Q&A helps surface crucial information: \u201cThe benefits for using Q&A for me are speed and efficiency. If I come across a keyword or some context I\u2019m not familiar with, Q&A is my first port of call.

It can answer your questions using data from across your entire workspace and synthesize concepts from your knowledge library, but it doesn\u2019t have access to wider knowledge. In addition to Q&A, Notion\u2019s AI package also includes Writer and Autofill.",
        "Writer assists you in drafting, editing, brainstorming and research Call up Writer by hitting space in any page, and you can start drafting and editing text, generating ideas, researching a topic, and more. Writer will look to the outside world for knowledge to help you draft content. It can understand the context of the page you\u2019re currently on. You can ask it to perform actions (like summarizing) on the content of the page, but it won\u2019t necessarily take wider workspace information into context.

        "Database views display the same content in different ways Databases are collections of pages Think of Notion databases as filing cabinets or notebooks. Each database serves as a container, letting you easily organize multiple Notion pages in a single structure. In the screenshot below, every row of the table is a page within the database \"Docs.\" This gives you a birds' eye view of an entire collection of pages at once. When you need to dive deeper, each page in a database can be opened, revealing its detailed contents. Databases are pages themselves But wait - each database is also a page itself! This is powerful, because it allows you to move and nest databases alongside other content, just like any other page. Databases have properties",
        "To help you organize all of the pages within a database, properties can be added to contextualize, label, and augment each individual item. You can then search, filter, and sort by these property values. Database views display the same content in different ways Databases in Notion are not static. The set of pages within each database can be displayed in many different forms, or what we call views. In addition to table view, the contents of a database can be visualized as a list, board, calendar, gallery, or timeline - whatever makes the information the most useful.

        "Avoid complex reference chains Formulas and rollups are extremely powerful, but the more complex they are, the slower your database may be. For example, a formula that depends on several other formulas that each depend on rollups may take longer to calculate. Minimize the number of filters and sorts on formulas and rollups Databases that arefiltered and sortedonformulaandrollupproperties may take a bit longer to load. filtered and sorted formula rollup Filter on simple properties Adding filters based on simple properties such as select, multi-select, status, number, and date may improve the speed of your database. Even if you have complex filters, this may help by reducing the number of pages that need to be processed.",
        "Hide unnecessary properties If some properties are less important in your database view, hiding them may improve responsiveness and interactivity. Delete any unused pages We suggest removing any unnecessary or duplicative pages from your database to keep it as simple and up-to-date as possible.
